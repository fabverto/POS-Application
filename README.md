POS application with limited functionalities, adds up to 5 products and sums the total quantities and 
prices into a single total price. does not check for negative values. Some fields are not stored 
in the database, hence ere hardcoded for simplicity.

There is no remove button for added products and the database does not account for multiple items, it only lists category, 
part and product of first item. It does store total price and quantity.

The category, product and part drop down menus update dynamically fetching information from a database, based on previus selection.

Code hasn't been tested for bugs.
